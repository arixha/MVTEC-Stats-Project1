# MVTEC-Stats-Project1

## Steps for Pre-processing

*Everybody uploads his preprocessing script at the repository by calling it in that way: P1-Name-Stats-Prep.R
*We've decided to add a column with new data to the main database. Each of us has different data to see if some are relevant for the analysis. Each of us will add and combine one column from a different dataset:
    * Annia: Obesity
    * Rebecca: Global Health Security Index
    * Rocío: Causes of death
    * Victor: Temperature

### Our variables:
#### Qualitative:
* Government_Type
* Corruption_preception
* Causes of mortality ¿¿ I don't find Monthly/weekly/fortnightly by countries ??
* Unnecessary deaths ¿¿ I don't find Monthly/weekly/fortnightly by countries ??

OTHER...
* Cities with more Density Population
* Cities with aeroports

#### Quantitative:
* GDP_per_capita
* Density Population
* Obesity index
* Overweight 
* Acumulative Cases Covid
* Ages Covid
* Monthly or Weekly or Fortnightly Cases Covid ??
* Monthly or Weekly or Fortnightly Tests Covid ??
* Monthly or Weekly or Fortnightly Diabetes Prevalence Covid ??
* Monthly or Weekly or Fortnightly cardiovasc_death_rate Covid vs total deaths Covid ??
* Weekly_icu_admissions vs hospital_beds_per_thousand Covid ??
* [Pandemic preparedness & health security index](https://www.ghsindex.org/)
* [Government response index](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker)
